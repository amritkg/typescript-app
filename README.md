## Introduction

The orange component for each group displays image thumbnails that can be dragged and dropped into any of the green drop zones. The green drop zone will then display the image for five seconds before resetting to its green state. If a new image is dragged on a zone that already has an image, the new image will replace it and the timer will reset. Images do not disappear from the orange component, and the same image can be dragged onto multiple green dropzones.


## Project setup and compilation

On the terminal, run:

```

```
